The number of Oscar nominations this year yan swipe rat Or Nice Good American Fiction Or or very mast b nice nice anatomy hot dog messi past live i love Nuke Have You Seen Off This is the law of them American fiction remains a zone Interest is left and other things are left After watching the rest, how did you like Anatomy? I liked it, it was amazing, it was very layered. Unexpected for a film of you know one too just c A courtroom drama but plaid Very Farhad from Like Almost Like I Would Like Actually Some People Also Compared It To another Farhad, I have also visited two or three places. read butt A Courtroom Drama But Not Played For Solving a Case But for Character Study So Which Was Very Amazing You Know You're Not OK you want to solve the case in a way but you Are More Interested in What Led Them To That Point to This Thing and Now You Wake Up And you f and you need someone to blame and You're the One to Blame You Pet Fa by Own Standards and Your Fear of Failure This Is The Truth, it looked very good, very amazing. Interesting It's One Film That I Couldn't Appreciate et al I tweeted just today That sword is what anatomy of a fall Wanted to be, don't know why I got caught Comparing It With Sword When You Use Multiple You see the stand points and you see How does the sword look? Very nice sword, amazing. The movie is but I thought yes Talwar is quite different yes a yes but okay i get what you are Yes, because I couldn't Appreciate that okay like it's very linear Infact this is a review by Richard Brod He's Badged Anatomy of He's Said It's Like an airport novel is what you You have packaged it like cinema. Like the movie, they also like it very much. Well, I didn't come and I am working on my film. I am heartbroken by the one or two bad reviews that came. Even the Atom of Fall was breaking down so much If big reviewers can abuse then what is left Do I talk to you about films right now? Having a Deep Discussion Is Your First movie watching Memory So De Many Memory Ch R Movie Watching and first will be first and foremost Which I didn't know was a movie I thought I was seeing someone. Don't know why my parents have gotten me into this This Dark Room Where We Were A Couple Fighting and the film Vaj Nikah So Songs Yaad Hai And Some Snus From The The Film I Remember and I Felt Very Sad Couple Breaking Up They Some Kind of I Think Domestic abuse is also quite bad. It was an experience and I thought, what is this? happening and i mean why do we see Everyone is here so I was four and five eight That Time So I Didn't Even Know It's a Film And what is a film and you know we don't Have TV at home so there was no other visual Media at home was not a TV, it was radio. The songs you used to listen to on the radio and you don't know anything else. Didn't know one thing that songs exist Suddenly go to the movie So That Was The First Kind of Memory But I Was Kind Off Disoriented First Actual Memory Off A Film Where I Probably Appreciate It And liked it and wanted to Vaj Masoom Shekhar Kapur Film And That We Saw Again In a theater but probably at that time Six and three again, there was no TV in the house till then P. But perhaps he had so much wisdom that this film and there is a story and there are people And I Was Obsessed With This Song Lakdi Ki Kathi I liked that song so much That I couldn't sleep without her, so it was Like a daily thing at bedtime Pay My Parents Had to Play the Song Cassette And I Would Never Fall Into Sleep Do It's Absolutely Not the Lullaby Another Lullaby in the Film Do Naina Ek Kahani Jo That's actually a lullaby to the baby in the movie. butt hyper energy song to sleep My Lullaby and I Use to Fall Asleep Listening to that song, that movie when we saw Then I Felt Like the First Impression And First Kind of Power au Cinema's OK It can move you It can take you into another World It Can Show You How the Human Feel Can Make You Feel Connected to Other Humans Don't Even Exist in reality just on screen so that's for me First Kind of Falling in Love with Cinema The moment was at six and then and then after That's what I think by the time I turn 1989 so born in 80th year off Aashiqui Maine Pyaar Kiya 87 Vas Qayamat Se Qayamat Tak Cha Again I Seen And By That Time I Think I Was Kind of I Understood What Cinema Is But Qayamat Se Qayamat Tak Made Me Very sad because both die spoiler If You Haven't Seen It for 30 Years So Sorry Too late but both R and Chawla die Something Like This You To Happen In My House Like you said you had every night To listen to it like your parents do too That was for the juggler in my house. So When Me and My Brother Use to Come Home So my brother used to watch Baazigar on VCR was VCR then and by the time we went to school After that they did not look, they did not eat Used to eat repeatedly on loop everyday juggler Baazigar has been played Wa and which is that Ra and you also loved Juggler and yer it was it was my brother to me Yes yes I remember like in parts Imagery yaad rahi aap lock film yaad rahe hai You're in it for when you drop it off the roof Do you remember that tea scene, that one that makes you laugh? I don't remember the scene Ending of Baazigar for Some Ri Madan Chopra Remember I'm gonna make a reel The Madan Chopra syndrome that basically you You go and you come from behind and the power You have seen that change happens Look at me also happens in Captain Phillips I'm the Captain I'm Thinking About Madan Chopra Very Fined by the Depiction of Madan Chopra Syndrome in Films You Can Think Of Any I Think Original Madan Chopra Syndrome Was way back in a very different context But Sangam Have You Seen Sangam So This Y Rajendra Kumar and Vanti Mala and Raj So It's a Love Triangle Kind of Thing Ra Raj Kapoor loves Bajanti Mala but because of this. Who is his best friend actually? Given Him Shelter as an Orphan and Something So has grown up in his house. Typical which later happens in Dil To Pagal Hai Bhi You are used and you sacrifice yourself. Love Because Someone Gave You Shelter as a Kid And that person's love is bigger than your love So Rajendra Kumar Love Way Janti Mala And Raj kapoor also love mala but only a dozen tell them Because he thinks that is his first right What ever they both have the first right and then Rajendra Kumar I am sent to war and he Disappeared Dead and Then Raj Kapoor Kind of Proposes to Her and She Accept and then he comes back so that power But by the time he came back she was still ringing the rosary. Have fallen in love with Raj Kapoor and let him sleep This conflate great conflate done many Times But Ya Very Different Version Wa Ya I have another very different version of this Change of power came a stanley q brick Which is the one in which political There is a film in which everyone sits at a round table There are war films in which a lot The debate is happening like oh yes so the bomb The Bomb One The Bomb One Ya Ya So There's a Bomb in That I don't know the name of Dear John. Dear John, what would have happened to me then? Revealed in Dear John's Are the Letters the Wives' Right to See Their Husbands When They Go Because of two verses they now understand this The groom has gone so late there is no chance that he Might not come back there's a chance so do Find Another Partner When That Person Is Away So They Write a Dear John Letter Oh Wow Okay I din know this I wa like holy [ __ ] so one Of the bums had a name of dear John or ok so that's one satta I remembered my festival and I am nicer than you. All India rank along with recommendations I also want to talk about and because Remember when we were at the first screenings And every time we met I also use to ask you that you direct When are you doing it? When are you doing it directly? I don't have any direction but a very fast ticket. There is always a takeaway like Joy Akhtar Had said at one place have good food on set all Food makes people happy and every Greta Garwick She says when I don't understand that What to do Start switching off the Then one by one we turn on the lights That's when my mind is not working I always studied at no film school. Make sure to have the actors enter and Exit frames are based on such nuances Is this one of yours for me? The direction was that not for me right now It is very difficult for me to tell right now Was there any such that I had my take away What then was important a few things What I Learn from Other Film Makers Only But One Thing Which Anurag Told Me Anurag Kashyap Before I Went for the Shoot I asked him I asked bunch of friends What should R film makers do? three or four people who told me things I followed him and Sum of Them and Very Helpful Anurag Told Me Whenever You're Confused and One You Have Less Time and One You Don't Know If You Can Take As Many Shots As You Want And If You Know What Ever Resources Are Less Just Focused on the Eyes of the Actor If You Can See The Eyes Don't Make Them Perform Without Their Eyes Visible You Will Get the scene then get a shot one shot athlete Where their eyes are completely visible and emotions Search in it and you should meet obviously now If there is no emotion in the actor's eyes Then That Shot Is Wasted But Work On That If You're short on time that was a great thing Which I Tried So Which I Tried Basically on the edit also so we'd chuck Shots If We Had to Like Short an Something And Get to the Point Quickly We'd See Shots Where the Eyes Are Talking the Most And that's something we try in the Edit also through out eyes so basically A I Know It's Not Possible But for a Lot of Films If You Put Them on Mute and Watch Them If the Eyes Are Working the Film Will Work Was so just see it on mute and yay will Find the Emotion in the Eye Because the Lips Are Who Mooted So That Was One Very Good What Ever Tip Anurag Gaev I am Manish Sharma the Director of Fan and Shoe Romance and Band Baaja Baaraat So Hi Told I Wear Comfortable Clothes Because It's Going to be a long day so don't think that You're the Director You Have to Dress Properly You Should Be Seen Like You Know Someone Who's Like That's What Nola Does Power Dressing in a Way in His Own Way Always wearing on the sets also Wearing a Jacket and It Works for Him Shar but what Manish told me was very useful. So I am just a pajama and there is no point in doing so. Comfortable Shirt and Pajamas See Through Suit And It Was Very Relaxing So It's Not a Film Making Tip But It Is a Film Making Tit When You're Dealing With Humans You Are dealing you're present there's someone Have to be comfortable in this space so that Very good tip, one thing came Learn on the Sets I Want to Continue Going Forward in What ever i do in future Is Always Listen to the Feedback Like Alav Feedback on the Sets No Shot Is Final Till It This is final so don't be like that Had a short breakdown and it's like this And this is how the actor will be if anything Also improvising because of the joy Of Film Making Were You Are you have something you have The Blueprint You Have the Script You Know How You're going to shoot it how you're going to edit it There's some in your mind but a lot of Times the Magic Happens Because People Have the Space to Manwar and People to Have the Space to Innovate and play while still remaining happy in this month A l in that scene the very famous scene now [ __ ] There is no end to this sorrow. Doesn't End In The Script It Was Not Written That He Will Cry and the Friends Will Go and Hug Him and All That Was All Improvise Just Because Neeraj Gave Them Them Space Neeraj Gave Vicky and Every Other Actor The Space to Just Keep Improvising and Keep playing the shot and he won't cut it It went on and on and it just happened while Well, that last one was not in the script. So the actual chunk What's Now in the Edit Is a Lot of It Improvised I Mean The Lines Are There But The Crying Wasn't There The Way Vicki Has Taken That Scene To Her Easy means taking his time and Neeraj and Avinash Arun have given him time And he uses that time to like to make one off The Most Talked About Scene from the Film So Ya Being a Writer is That Difficult for You I mean friend, he is just playing, he is doing anything. It means that there is no beating from inside like this. Because you know that movie Now the shoot is completed on like 20 Even after fast edit the sound is late Multiple Layers Where You Will Still Have a Chance to Re Look and There Are Multiple Shots Right Ya Not Saying This Is The One Shot You have taken four five shots, four five takes have taken [music] You have to come to the same place the next day also. Can Go Back and You Know the Rush Some Times You can come back to a location like in Masaan We Did Go Back to Some Location in All India Rank Also Couple of Locations We Had to Go We are left with a couple of shots from back to hostel. So we went back so you're like this is Not Like Being Live Stream Right Now You have done it now, there is time, slowly it will be edited there I came to sleep Feel there is enough space to still or Manipulate lock it means make me think of you Shared Love for Richard Link Later It's Like Link Letter School of Thought Right Ki Aake Baat let's talk for 10 years rahe ya ya ya o that to e of course that is a dream i know what they did Well that won't happen again but but how Link Letter Doesn't Just In Boyhood Boyhood Wa ha ha sab mein hi means in general ts vat hi daj hi Just Sits With The Actor And His Crew And They Just Talk and Then Something Emerges Out of It's Almost Like Improvised Theater That's the kind of improvised cinema that happens. Is so off course he's on some other level of Craft and some other levels of space also In the Sense of the Kind He's Given to Make a film over 12 no one will give years here But but I know what you're saying to do I enjoy it and there is something in it A different kind of cinema is being made, so I Hope to or Do Something in the Same Space If Not over like obviously not over 12 years But even the world will not last for 12 years I think yes at least 12 months Let someone shoot over one year you meet once Every Month and You Know Kind of Sit for Two Three days and do one to seams and or may Remember when we wrote a book almost 5 years ago? Did the episode when you came to our house So you said one line, you recommended a Documentary Hearts of Darkness and You said this is Apocalypto Kalipan should come that if you If you haven't seen it, let me ask you a question. want But the question is about film recommendation. Whatever film aspiring film makers or If you are watching this movie or picture episode, So what is that movie that you haven't seen? shame on you There are many, many, many of them are needed. that's what i was thinking Because you said that you'll be talking about Recommendations And If You Don't Give Me A Promotion or very specific promotion Films Which Are You Know From That Decade to think about, now just this question If You Ask Me Who Are the Films People Should be ashamed of if they haven't seen ashamed Off Them Sales If They Haven't Seen Dose Films I Can Give You Probably 500 Films even in that list because very All are there but still I will just say Be a Few Directors You'll Have to Have Too Right Sea One Andar Ve It's very simply just that A Top 100 Debut Films Oh Okay So You Will Get a Fantastic List You'll Get a Fantastic List You'll Have Blood Simple In That List You'll Have a Lady Bird In That List You'll Have Being John Malkovich In That List You Will Have Flight In That List You Know and Black Friday in That List So They Give Lots Of First Films Luck Bye Chance Talking About Indian Films Butt Outside Also Like You Will Have Pather Panchali is in that list so if you go just Bye That's Late Are Very Good End Point Or Just Enter Start the Journey of Because It Will Obviously Give U If U Se 100 Usm Se 70 80 Film Makers must have become greats after Words 20 Might Be There Who Have Made Only One and Two and Three Films and You Know After That They Did Not What Ever Fulfilled Promise They Had In Their First Film But Even Than Do 100 First Grade Films Are A great way to know cinema especially for a First time film maker because the first Films Are Always Made With Limited Resources No One Very Rarely Even You Know Zoya Attar Luck Baa Chan Wanted To Cast Yano Big actor and even farhan d role but even Zoya Attar with L'Her Resources and Yano Industry's Privilege and Where Still Had to Struggle to Make the First So First Films Give You a Sense off late rones Late Experimentation time I don't give dam attitude yes and also A Very Unique Voice Some Times Not Fully Formed Some Times Fully Formed Some Times You Know It But It's Original Special With Good First Films I'm Saying All the Good First Films So That's a Great Way So you know start with okay all the great Film Makers You Know But You May Know Them For Their Fifth Example Lot of People No Parasite But Yes You Know You Go Back To Bangas Early Films and You Go to PTA first film sorry pts first film Was PTA Heart Was The First Heart Too Maybe yes so or so PTS first Film Heart Now It's Very Like You Can't Imagine ok this guy will then go on to this Epic film also heart is such an intimate small Film and Nolan First Film Following Following or so there is this rawness there is This ambition lacks resources everything so For Aspiring Filmmakers I Think It Is a Great Way to Understand Cinema Instead of seeing of course the classic Classes You Have to See and You Know You Have to no good and mid What Ever Mid Career Spielberg Says Laker Mid Career What Everyone But Or I would like to do things here limited The resource thing is even for Nolan. Used to apply but he followed To make it look authentic We had no money so we had no guns Could have shown because I couldn't hold a fake gun When she arrives, she calls her antagonist Gave me a hammer to whip people Then this brain works the right way. That thing is very amazing First Films R Great learning tool and then others that you can Do is see the first and second and third what Ever Short Films Some of the Film Makers Have made so for example this ruban Lan His Short Film That Thing on a Bridge Yes, you recommended me, so I came. Think It's Called Some Random Case And Something's Experiment Number Something's It's Called But It's a Single Take Film Almost Single Take May Be In The End It Cuts To Another POV but most of it is single take so is Kinds of Movies That Are Just Made Porly from a narrative point of view with No Budget and All So They Are Great Again Learning Tools So Just Go and See Offcourse Doodle Berg Is Very Very Famous Now So Ya So That's a Like Small List of Recommendations No No this is amazing and I have never done anything like this I didn't think that if you just like Pick up was my way of getting into it that I caught a film maker who If you like link letter then I am very dirty I was obsessed with finding a very good man. I thought only humans were good so I Earlier I used to think that is there any movie Makers Who Do Not Smoke because it was so bad for me that So I don't smoke, I was like that friend Jana only smokes because of me Who was new to the industry? Stop now and then I came to know about the letter. If he doesn't smoke then let's go and enter. There is a branch inside it, he said somewhere Go all Robert Downey Sr. Look at the pictures I said ok Robert Saw pictures of Downey Sr. and said Of a berg man so i know a pasona But did you see the rest of Bergman's pictures? It is my gift that it became a film school. Just found one ok what did this Person like and a tree grow up from there Gaya And I Really Love This Process Because E venturi lets you touch everything People will also say yes or true or so hene I think again a fantastic film maker Watch his early films May I Be You Know A LOTS OF PEOPLE FOUND NK AFTER RAMOR GUT Nominated and One and Oscar I Think It Did One Did Win No Some Foreign Film and All But NK Initial Films We Were He Was A He was a completely unknown and like a local Film Maker And Then You Know After A Point His I Think Funny Games Got Remembered In Hollywood And But Before The Lee Film Amazing So That ikt i tired blowz Wa So Ha So It's Good Way To Enter Do You Like what's your opinion of past Lives Past Lives I Wasn't Super Into I liked it but I felt it was to Playing for Almost Like I Could Sense Thing's You Keyword So the core Philosophy of the film with note connection Between People also had a name Some Thing So That for me felt like a Ope more than just formed idea in the film And I felt that he was very amazing. cracked butt It Didn't Do Anything for Me After a Point for Me You Know a Lot of People Compared Three of Us to Past Lives Yes Yes So I Know I Might Be Bias That Three Off In us I was evolved as a dialogue Writer But I Felt That Past Life Was Kind of a bit of a Bet for the Oscars, call it a bet or was it a little I felt like that, I liked the butt end. Not Even If You Don't Compare It With Anything Else Looked Good But Then I Felt that like could have been they like the subject Matter Promise in the Beginning of Its Going To Be a Heavy Film It Was That Was My Eye Felt it was a bit too light weight given the Space It Had Like It Could Have Been Like Crushing It Wasn't Crushing It Wasn't heart breaking it Was Sad Or Like It Left You With A Bit Off Sad and Joy What Ever the Mix Of feelingless A Film Wanted to Know Wanted to Break Me Kind of a thing like In the mood for love you know she's gonna have it Same Promise and Di Live Up to the Promise Or we did a poll in the Thai community that Your Favorite in School Lovers Meeting Again Which movie is Past La The Of Us and 96 good 96 96 i love that was very very Well Made Film or End Very movie yes I want to ask you one more thing I want this is something I'm really Very interested in everyone's life All failures are your favorite failures.

If 10000 copies are sold and it's a big Thing and if its reviews are only two then it means He also bodes as an artist again What does it mean to have a The need for reviews as a yes boder It does this for two reasons: That As An Artist You Want Your Work To Be Not Appreciate But Criticize That The manner and the people Athletes Talk About the Layers or Triads Toot Right It Feels Not Just Good But Also It Needed for an artist to feel validated Intus brother, I have achieved something with some hard work. which is cast at some point on that Documentation should be fine, people can read it at home. They Might Like It They Might Say Hey You made this butt very nice and he made it big. I told myself that it did not reach you. Only numbers came, numbers never came think any Artist You Know Prime Goal in Life Okay, so many copies sold or so many tickets sold? Did the film earn so many crores, friends? Numbers Are Like They Are Good for Getting The Next Project They're Good for People I actually supported the project so the Producers Publishers and the Great For Them and it should be but for an artist True Appreciation Is Meeting Like Minded People and Feeling Understood and Feeling Heard And the feeling scene that's something I feel Is the Prime What Ever Needed of an Artist To Be Understood Well I thought of this Had this work been done then someone would have understood him that Don't understand either when someone says than you Feel Like OK Even If It's Five People Even If It's 10 People and You Know You Have Sold lets say 1 lakh tickets to something And this is what I understood from 10 People Come At You Feel great about it in that way a bad Review Must Be Better Than Inferanti a bad review is still trite Engage with the Work What Ever Any Review And If It's Trite What Ever Let's Say Trash It Saying This Didn't Work And This was intended this way but ended up Being This Way Okay Atleast You Saw the Intention Atlist You Tried So and Reviews Are All Bad review of Good for Me It's Not About Good review yes bad review for the film and adventure right in Documentation but at least there is a review Let's have a conversation about it and that's it good sleep Don't You Know Bad Reviews Like One Off The Reviews on One of the Books I've Written Is On N This Short Story Collection Is one star and below it is written that was not fun Datchi also wrote one star, did not enjoy it Like ok great this guy is actually Buying my experiment with truth And then going there and saying no fun It's like Gandhi ji, you like it a bit. write again one more time Experiment, this is yours for me Experiments Are Not Enough Than I'm Like Hey, he has the entire life of Gandhiji and this Not even that Gandhiji has written fiction. Gandhiji has written his life and this Guy is not impressed with Gandhiji's life So why would he be impressed with me Fiction So Totally Fine So Ya A I remember I told Hansal Mehta Sir When the episode was done with Hi Was Telling Me that they read restaurant reviews a lot I think New York Times or New Yorker Somewhere So Everyone Has These Reviews The fashion of your world's favorite reviewers Who is in regard to any medium book music o no i don't have a name Because I don't do that for me The World's Favorite Reviews Are Actually The imdb reviews which are user reviews I am especially fond of films. Reviews which are mainstream and whatever The reviewers are Even Brody and What Ever I rarely read that for me the Best Thing to Do After Watching a Film If If I Like the Film and If I Hate It Chance whose chances are very less because I see very few movies where If there is even the slightest doubt that something will go wrong, I I watch films very thoughtfully for me Watching a Film is Like Getting into a Short term relationships are bad I don't get into relationships very much. That yes, it is sure that it will not look bad. This film may seem a bit average or These three categories are good or great Hoti Hai So If You Like A Film You Want To Read More About It So the First Thing I Do Is I go to IMDb and first I read All the Trivia and Then I'm Very Happy When I click show the spoiler ones also Because I have seen the movie I will read the spoiler ones also then it is written in it Does anything happen in that scene? What ever some spoiler butt was shot It's Fun Then I Go to the Reviews User Reviews and Lots of Great Reviews There And They Are Just I MDB Users So That Community Is Great Which Is Now Building Another Community E Now Letter Box Where I'm not very used to the pup yet I'll go and check the letter box right now. A little navigation in me i'm not that much Used to it but I mdb I love I love the Reviews and they are the best reviewers on On the planet for me right now this community off or maybe you said something I immediately remembered that it was a good film. Is that after the picture is over? Pushes you to go and search about it and read About it or it feels so right to me If I See Something I Like That Yes ok and i am not doing money that means yes ok neither means it's that means i Unofficial on Reddit's official discussion Reaching the discussion or not or or or yes and a very good one on i mdb There was a forum, it has closed down now. Forum Where You Can Just Put Questions and Answers About the Film Now Dev Removed That Forum Used to Be One of My Top Favorite Thing Where you'll just talk about that one That scene in Flow the Cuckoo Ness is ours What is the interpretation for and the and the final Thing the climax and that dream and that What ever this kind of people long again It would be great if theoretical answers come. It used to be so yes absolutely I think great The Sign of a Great Film Late Too Three things like this, my two three are strange, strange The first rule is that A great film is what inspires great Writing after words, if any film The reviews are very good and the reviews It doesn't mean that there are five star reviews. The reviews are detailed and slightly different from the film. Chacha is making some talk reviewer right Better t's the sign of a great film then Great Art Leads to Great Art like the simple formula second the sign off You're How Much You Like The Film Is How Much You Want to Read About It afterviewinit watch everything if twam comes I liked it very much, so why not? You will see again friend, it is very good in one go. It means that there is a lot in that movie. All the details are there and at once the eye and If ears and senses cannot catch everything You should know watch it Give him the twins so if you are Confused About a Film and Even If You Are not there a film the second time the second Time a Good Movie Will Get Better a Bad The Film Will Get Versus the Experience of It If It Becomes Un I thought it was fun the first time. The movie was, let's watch it again today and are watching. yes and you some It was late, something may be the day Great you are in happy mood good company the The film Had Like a Good You Know Manipulative Quality Which You Like in That First Time But Second Time You Know The Manipulation Now you are like not now man and if you Like It Better the Second Time Than That Sign of a very good film It Gets Better with Every Viewing and Atlist one to three till third viewing and Sorry if you liked it the second time A complicated flow chart is being made. I'm better than the first time for the second time If you like it more then definitely third time See because then you will be able To See the Actual Film for All It's Now You Know All the Tropes Now You Know the Manipulation You still like it the second time the third time Now watch it and watch it for other details Also it may definitely happen if first Second time was good or third time was bad It won't seem like it will just give you something and It Will Flatten to That Point and Then You Like ok I am done with this film Three Times I've Now Completely What Ever The last is taken out in the sugarcane machine. Me Ch Is Your Most Watchable Film In Your Hole Life The Master Na Pat I Seen Lot Of Times Whenever I turn on the TV I mean whenever anything I'm not doing it I'll start it from Any Point That I Really Love There Will Be Blood I Really Love Boogie Night So Lots Of PTA Films Yeh Toh Hi Maart Baah Any film of PTA starts from anywhere Do it and it will be fun but yes this Definitely the master top will give after that b blood Oh five runs, how did you like it O I love you That's That Also I've Seen Multiple Times Butt Not as many times As the Master's End and Phantom Thread O I Loved it Phantom Thread Again so Phantom Thread What happened to me was that when I saw it for the first time I Was It in the Theater It Was Not Playing With Subtitles Just Got Used To Subtitles Ki to first time visually it was stunning And There But Then There Was Something Strange About the Film I Couldn't Really Get Into It Also random, there were no subtitles Secondly, that PVR or wherever the film is played. There that random interval slate comes in between He is saying something out of nowhere and suddenly The interval came and then after that you Show Gutka ad. Gutka means don't Gutka. eat it and show it and then that fufu those 50 types A So It Takes You Out of Punishment Then I Was Like So Then I Watched It Again When It Came on OTT and like proper good house I'm in the mood so I loved it a lot Of Course It's Not For Me It's Still Not In The League of Nations' Ambition in Terms of Just Ambition Off Showing the Human Greed and It Was More of Another intimate setting is the scale that Joe Joe of PTA Off the Human Condition They show the spectrum in the rest of the film. He didn't have that much ambition in it. But still it was beautiful in my opinion One of the Greatest Actors Who Have Ever Lived Like Was Philip Seymour Huffman Meaning Someone Just Amazing And From Here To See Him In These Two PTA Films From Boogie Nights to the master This is a journey or a lot of movies. A lock I just came for small scenes Ka Stop Thinking About Lock Their Someone Ai What do you think is the Indian equivalent? India's Philip Seymour Huffman according to you from which It will be very difficult, it means any miracle. If the actors are from outside then India's us. Meaning, only Irrfan Saheb comes to mind. Irrfan Apart from sir, who would be that very difficult? Have to tell but because again we don't write Two Kinds of Roles for Like the Kind Of The Role Philip Huffman Has Done in The Master V Don't Have These Kinds of Roles We Don't Have Written Dos Kind of Roles If We Write I Am There's a Lot of Actors Are Capable of Just That You Know They Are Not Given That Space Too Perform in two complicated characters And so it becomes very difficult here pe means like recently not at all Comparing But I'm Saying Recently This Vijay Maurya's movie 'Mast mein rehne ka' The film is that of Jackie Shroff and it is performing. Stunning it just shows that kind of role you Jackie Shroff or whoever is with him will write. Contemporary actors have been there for him Fully Capable Just That Now Is Writing Dos Rolls and Jackie Shroff in In Aranya Kaandam for example the way is Perform from Aaranya Kaandam to Mast Mein Rahne ka to his early work parinda and l He is a fantastic actor just don't know Roles To Justify His Talent One Person Who Really Excites Me a Lot from India Jaideep alav oh Jaideep is fantastic great He is or He is the He is already a Fantastic great actor but he is the Potential to create Something Unique Going Forward a Space For You Know the Kind of Actor Superstar What Irrfan Was Meant to Be and Almost There and or in their eyes I did not Also noticed in Three of Us, it is late this Exhaustion that you can see through your eyes That means I squint. Don't know a little and that too in the underworld I saw it, I said what is this, friend, this and that I feel that way about very few people When I did it with Sudeep Sharma sir too Same thing was said for him and the others Suvinder who is the lead actor of our Kora vicky or what is the face off oh Like Russian Novel Prog Nist Thing Ya Very Friends, I have seen many face likes throughout my life. the sorrow that Worries, troubles, happiness all on the face at once They have come as marks, so this is it Fantastic or is there a question which My Audience Hates But I Love Too Ask kya broken heart se music And if the heart is not broken Can you not create good Art absolutely not means I don't believe it. This is absolutely wrong Music Art Any The thing turns out if you're curious and if You Can Be Curious Without You Knowing Broken Heart Actually I Don't Know Broken Heart Does it help and give this ora CreatedDocumentsFragment That a man will be happy if he remains curious You have to be can become good art Curious You Have to Be Constantly Willing To Learn Willing to Explore the World Willing to Explore Your Inner Self and Just In Touch With The Humanity Ultimately It's About Finding Connection With Fellows Humans every art ya know and they judge No Central Body Says This Is Art And This is not a panel of people like 10 20 100 Art Connects and Some Art Connects to Five People and Some Art Connects to 5 Lakh and 50 Lakh and both R Art And It's Just About Your Ability To Create something which is original for You End Feels Feels End I have to give, I don't understand this. that is that If your heart is broken You may find people telling you to encourage you. Let's say friend, you should become an artist. hee It doesn't mean that it will go because you see. as many Across is also a good artist History is not that the heart was broken They became great only after the effect of what they have done. Great work in their happy phases of life Right in their stable phases of life and that this is so this is No end, no phase ever came for you. You Were Attracted to the Sad Part of Being an Artist Means Because I Relate To what you are saying but there is a phase, isn't it? When no one wants to be sad, But that phase came when I also felt that I thought that if your heart gets broken then you can make art out of it. Can you or you will become an artist, that phase I too was once upon a time, how old? This phase is 20 years old when I was Dating So I Was Dating And I Was Like if it didn't work out I was thinking about the relationship, what can I do? If I do, an idea comes to my mind that i will make a documentary Called I Don't Know What It Was Called But The The Concept Was Heartbreak How People Deal With Heartbreak and I Thought I'd Just Travel With my camera, a very romantic idea. Tha India Very Ya In A Very Imtiaz Ali idea that yes brother go out with the camera. Go and Just Ask Random People About How to Give Delt with the heart breaks and then make A Film Around That Of People Dealing With heart Breaks and then I thought yes look good My art comes from heartbreak Right now I am afraid of the possibility of heartbreak. Thought of the concept of a documentary but Then I Didn't Ever Know That Heartbreak It didn't happen and then neither did this documentary. I made it and later I felt that it was very This is a basic documentary idea. What was the meaning of such a great heart break? The name was boring first first draft the idea came Something last related to the movie No Amazing I ask questions then I will move to Other segments are there politically Incorrect movie whose someone or something Politics is totally off but you like yes I think there will be many like this because The Film Fm 90s So Regressive so regressive and or politically Incorrect in a way but I liked it at that time But you can still enjoy it now can also enjoy hoon aaronic yes like means like we are yours Who I Thought Was a Very Aggressive Kind of Film End for Two Times Probably There was a little progressiveness in that Madhuri Dixit Was Shown Someone Who Had A Jobs for those who were studying computers Read Science and Something She Said About Computers And the scene in which she is playing billiards are staying and he asks coming from above What are you doing and she says Computers are reading like wow you know Career woman at that time she told but that Elsewhere throughout the film the computer is far away. That chocolate juice ice cream was not far away. She was eating toffee but I can still Enjoy That Film in a Strange Way Just For Fun Because Nostalgia and All a Song I Really Like and Enjoy Even Till Now Is Actually a very problematic song in That way and your name with red scarf tell and so there are those things ch Nostalgia Does To You Where You See Things In A particular lens and kind of eye ignore The Politics and Don't Even Know About The politics of it A in a way blind spots in a way Privilege is a red scarf song Which was that song of eyes and which I I liked it very much, it was very catchy but it came recently Was playing it and someone's female friend Said That This Is a Very Horrible Song and We Ver Actually You Know a Lot of We Have Very Trauma Related Memories to This Song Because You Know Horrible Boys on the Streets Play That While They're Going to College And There's Something So Everything We Know About They big section of society have a very Different memory attached to it so came besides that Don't Know Andaz Apna Apna Me Be Me Be Me Be Aggressive in Some Ways I Enjoy That Film A Lot But I'm Sure If You Analyze There Wood be a lot Of Politically Incorrect Thi So Now I Tell You I would like to move the books from you to talk I would like you to understand I need to ask.
